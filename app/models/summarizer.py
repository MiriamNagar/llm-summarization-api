Summarizer Module
=================
Provides a prompt-building utility for text summarization.  
The module does not generate text itself, but prepares prompts that can be fed into a text generation model (like Phi-3-mini-4k-instruct).

Example:
    >>> from app.models.summarizer import Summarizer
    >>> prompt = Summarizer.build_prompt("Your input text here.")

    It ensures that the output is suitable for translation back into Hebrew or other languages.
